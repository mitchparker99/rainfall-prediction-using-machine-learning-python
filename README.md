# Weather Data Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and classification of weather data using various machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to predict specific weather conditions based on a range of meteorological parameters such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file named `Rainfall.csv`. It contains the following features:

- `day`: The day of the measurement.
- `pressure`: Atmospheric pressure.
- `maxtemp`: Maximum temperature recorded.
- `temperature`: Temperature at the time of measurement.
- `mintemp`: Minimum temperature recorded.
- `dewpoint`: Dew point temperature.
- `humidity`: Humidity percentage.
- `cloud`: Cloud cover percentage.
- `rainfall`: Whether or not it rained.
- `sunshine`: Hours of sunshine recorded.
- `winddirection`: Direction of the wind.
- `windspeed`: Speed of the wind.

The dataset consists of 366 rows and 12 columns.

## Project Structure

1. Data Preprocessing: The data is first loaded into a pandas DataFrame and the initial exploration, including checking the dataset's shape and the first few rows, is performed.
2. Feature Engineering: Various preprocessing techniques such as standardization and oversampling are applied to prepare the data for modeling.
3. Modeling: The following machine learning models are utilized for classification:
    - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
    - XGBoost Classifier
    - Logistic Regression
4. Evaluation: The models are evaluated based on their performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost imbalanced-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/weather-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd weather-classification
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook main.ipynb
    ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to perform data analysis and model training.

## Results

The results of the model evaluations, including metrics and visualizations, are available within the Jupyter Notebook.
